                I grew up in Vermont and graduated from Champlain College with a Bachelor of Science in Health Information Technology. After exploring my chosen field and moving down the east coast, I began programming for personal enjoyment and haven't stopped since. I love building &amp; designing experiences in almost equal measure. Other interests include reading, my two adorable dogs and hiking.<br><br>

                This website showcases my work and current projects. <br><br>
